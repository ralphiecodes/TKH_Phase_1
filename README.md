📌 Featured Engineering Milestones
🪓 1. Multi-Tiered Defense-in-Depth Engineering (Week 11 & 12)

    Perimeter Firewalls: Deployed kernel-level iptables rule-sets inside secure DMZ zones to enforce strict egress traffic parameters, dropping all unauthorized traffic directed at internal subnets (10.0.5.0/24) and database hubs (10.0.5.50:3306).
    Network Intrusion Detection (IDS): Authored customized signature profiles inside Suricata to identify application exploit attempts, generating high-priority tracking alerts for automated ICMP sweeps and unauthorized layer-7 malicious User-Agent signatures (Ghost_Scanner_v1).
    Host Endpoint EDR Policies: Architected and loaded custom XML detection schemas via Sysmon to trace volatile process behaviors, capturing unauthorized volume operations and precursor ransomware events (delete shadows).

🩻 2. Digital Forensics & SIEM Incident Response (Week 10)

    Volatile Memory & Disk Carving: Interrogated raw memory dumps (memdump.raw) using low-level string extractions, and parsed raw file-system media blocks using The Sleuth Kit (fls -r, icat) to defeat anti-forensic deletions and pluck active malware payloads (Resume.exe) directly from unallocated sectors.
    ELK SIEM Threat Hunting: Standardized telemetry aggregation schemas inside Elasticsearch and Kibana to process thousands of distributed server events, mapping active host brute-forcing vectors, lateral Active Directory pivots utilizing compromised Domain Admin accounts, and outbound data exfiltration thresholds.

🌪️ 3. Full-Stack Web Application & API Chained Exploitation (Week 9)

    Vulnerability Chaining: Orchestrated an end-to-end compromise chain against corporate internal portals by combining tautology-based SQL Injection (' OR 1=1 --) authentication bypasses, database schema mapping via advanced UNION SELECT extractions, and persistent Stored XSS session-hijacking.
    API Security & Business Logic Auditing: Utilized Burp Suite to analyze, manipulate, and execute ID Swapping requests to uncover Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) defects, and executed parameter manipulations via Burp Intruder to compromise back-end transactional logic.

⛓️ 4. Privilege Escalation, Lateral Movement & Pivoting (Week 8)

    Vertical Privilege Escalation: Executed low-level exploitation vectors via Metasploit, establishing automated persistent cron-job reverse shells and executing shell escapes utilizing misconfigured binaries via GTFOBins (/usr/bin/find).
    Subnet Pivoting: Engineered tactical proxies within compromised internet-facing nodes, using automated routing rules and SOCKS5 proxy gateways to tunnel scanning utilities into air-gapped, isolated database networks.
